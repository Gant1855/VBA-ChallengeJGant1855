 Unit 2: VBA Scripting

## Objectives, 

## I was tasked in this project to 

* Define building blocks of all programming languages: variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, and functions.
* Create simple VBA macros to trigger pop-ups and change cell values.
* Write VBA subroutines that use variables and conditionals.
* Develop and refine essential coding skills including syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
* Describe the basic syntax of a VBA `for` loop.
* Use`for` loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.
* Explain the value and basics of using nested `for` loops.
* Format spreadsheets by using VBA code.
* Loop through a table by using VBA code and check for changes in values.


## To do this I had to: 

* Calculate the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* Calculate the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* Sum the total stock volume of the stock. After completing the analysis, the VBA code changes the "Yearly Change" cells background color:
* Values greater than or equal to zero are colored green
* Values less than zero are colored red
